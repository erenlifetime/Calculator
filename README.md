# What's the Purpose?

I did it to improve myself and understand the methods more easily.

# How does it work?
You can use it just like a calculator.

A calculator is a machine that can perform a total of 8 operations and uses only numbers.

# What did i use?
This Project was made to MVC(Model-View-Controller)  
# Parameters

All parameters without default values will be required.

Param types of Int, Bool and String are natively supported. All other types will be passed as raw values exactly as they are, so if compiled you can pass anything.
# Dependencies
Sometimes it's useful to be able to pull in other Swift packages as dependencies to use in your script. This can be done by adding some special comments at the top of your file.
It must take the form:

Repo: is the git repo where a Swift package resides. This can take a short form of user/repo or an extended form https://github.com/user/repo.git

Library: a space delimited list of libraries to include from this package. This defaults to the repo name, which is usually what you want.

Version: the version of this package to include. This can either be a simple version string, or any of the types allowed by the Swift Package Manager Requirement static members.

# Libraries Used;
import Foundation		

import UIKit

# What did i use in the User Interface?
Horizontal Stack View 7 units		 

UIButton 19 units		

UILabel 1 units

Storyboard Entry Point 1 units	
# FeedBack

Please share your comments, good or bad, with me.

# Support

If your Swift command line tool builds with the Swift Package Manager than it will automatically install and run with calculator!

Make sure you have defined an executable product type in the products list within your Package.swift.
